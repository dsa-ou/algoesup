# Deepnote

Deepnote is the cloud based Jupyter notebook platform we recommend for writing your essays.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The platform was chosen
due to its simple interface, customisable environment, and features for collaborative
working.

{: .warning}
This Deepnote guide is limited in scope to the writing, sharing and critiquing of algorithmic essays. There are many features of the platform not covered here. See the [official documentation](https://deepnote.com/docs) for more extensive coverage.
