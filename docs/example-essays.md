# Example essays

These examples illustrate different ways of structuring essays and different writing styles.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300}

Some essays have a template that highlights the essay's structure and
the purpose of each section.
Clicking on the buttons below will open a *read-only* version of the essay or template.
They are rendered on-demand in your web browser, which may take a few seconds.

Once you have created a DeepNote account and copied our essay project,
as explained in [Getting started](getting-started.md),
you will have access to *editable* versions of the templates, so that
you can use them as starting points for your essays.

## Sum of 1 to *n*

This is a short and simple essay, suitable for those on introductory programming courses.
The essay shows two ways of calculating 1 + 2 + ... + *n* and compares their run-times.
The essay follows a simple structure, in which each approach is outlined, implemented
and tested before moving on to the next one.

## Jewels and Stones

This is a longer essay, for those on data structures and algorithms courses.
The problem is to count how many characters of a string occur in another string.
The essay solves the problem in three ways, with linear search, a set, and a bag/multiset.
The complexity of the three algorithms is analysed and compared to their run-time.

This essay follows a slightly different structure, in which each approach is outlined and
its complexity analysed, before deciding which approaches are worth implementing.

## Two Sum (two approaches)

This classic problem asks to find two numbers in a list that add up exactly to a given number.
This essay solves the problem in two ways, with brute-force search (nested loops)
and a map (Python dictionary).

## Two Sum (three approaches)
This is an extended version of the previous essay.
It adds a third approach, that sorts the list of numbers, and
it analyses the complexity of the three approaches.
