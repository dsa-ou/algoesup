# Library

The `algoesup` library provides support for testing, timing and linting code.

## Testing

This function can be used with any Python program.

The library requires `matplotlib` and `ipython`. 

::: algoesup
    options:
      heading_level: 3
      show_root_toc_entry: false
      members:
      - test

## Timing

::: algoesup
    options:
      heading_level: 3
      show_root_toc_entry: false
      members:
      - time_functions
      - time_cases
      - time_functions_int

## Linting

These are to lint within a Jupyter notebook, cell by cell.

    options:
      heading_level: 3
      show_root_toc_entry: false
      members:
      - allowed
