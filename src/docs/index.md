# Algorithmic Essays

These documents provide guidance to help you write, critique, and share algorithmic essays.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

We define **algorithmic essays** as short reports, with code, that
explain and compare alternative approaches to solving a computational problem.

If you're a **student**, writing algorithmic essays benefits you in various ways:

- You reinforce your learning by explaining concepts to others and
  by exploring alternative solutions to the same problem.
- You develop professional skills like problem-solving, reviewing code,
  working collaboratively, and writing readable, tested, documented code.
- You learn how to use professional tools like code formatters, linters and
  type checkers, which improves your employability.
- You produce an artefact (the essay) for your portfolio for prospective employers.

If you're an **educator**, you can copy our resources from the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/dsa-ou/algoesup) and
adapt them to your course, due to our permissive licence (see below).

!!! example
    We provide some [example essays](example-essays.md) to illustrate what they are.

While many approaches to writing algorithmic essays are possible, we recommend
using **Jupyter notebooks**, the most widely used medium for mixing text and executable code.

If you're a student on M269, our data structures and algorithms course,
you can write an essay with your existing software and share it on the forums.

If you prefer a 'Google Docs'-like environment for collaborative
authoring and commenting on essays, we suggest **Deepnote**:

- free academic account
- no software installation necessary
- you can share your essays publicly (or just with a few people) to easily
    - receive and give feedback
    - work collaboratively on the same essay.

(We have no affiliation, commercial or otherwise, with Deepnote.)
