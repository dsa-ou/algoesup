1. Click the **Share** button in the top right corner of your essay.
   A small window will appear in the middle of the screen.

## Comment on essays

After sharing your essay, others will be able to comment on it.
You can also make comments on essays as part of the feedback process.
See our [feedback guide](feedback.md) for more information.

In Colab, comments are attached to a cell and are displayed next to the cell they refer to.

If you have edit or comment permissions, you can comment on a cell in one of three ways:

1. Select a cell and click the comment button (speech bubble) in the toolbar
   above the top-right corner of the cell.
2. Right-click a text cell and select 'Add a comment' from the pop-up menu.
3. Press Ctrl+Alt+M to add a comment to the currently selected cell.

You can resolve and reply to comments, and you can target comments to specific collaborators
by typing @[email address] (e.g., @user@domain.com). Addressed collaborators will be emailed.

The Comment button in the top-right corner of the page shows all comments attached to the notebook.
