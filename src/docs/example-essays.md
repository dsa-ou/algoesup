## Jewels and Stones

This is a longer essay, for those on data structures and algorithms courses.
The problem is to count how many characters of a string occur in another string.
The essay solves the problem in three ways, with linear search, a set, and a bag/multiset.
The complexity of the three algorithms is analysed and compared to their run-time.

This essay follows a slightly different structure, in which each approach is outlined and
its complexity analysed, before deciding which approaches are worth implementing.
